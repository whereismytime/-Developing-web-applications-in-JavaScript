# Movie Search

Welcome to the **Movie Search** project! This application allows users to search for movies, series, or episodes by title and view detailed information about each result. It provides a smooth, interactive experience with pagination, preloader animations, and a responsive design.

### üìå What is this?

This project is a web-based tool that lets users enter a movie title and search for related films, series, or episodes through the OMDb API. The app displays search results and offers details on selected items, including title, year, genre, director, and IMDb rating.

   - A high-resolution poster (or placeholder image) for each result enhances the user experience.

3. **Interactive UI with Pagination**
   - Smooth pagination allows users to navigate through search results page by page.
   - Pagination buttons dynamically adjust to display only a limited set of page options.

4. **Loading Indicator**
   - A loading spinner appears while data is being fetched, ensuring users know the app is working.
