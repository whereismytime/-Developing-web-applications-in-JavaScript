# Developing Web Applications in JavaScript

This repository contains assignments and independent projects from my JavaScript development course. Each project focuses on practical JavaScript skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with the Browser Object Model (BOM). Projects are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects

### 1. Browser Object Model / Document Object Model (BOM, DOM)

This project includes exercises and tasks related to BOM and DOM, providing practical experience in dynamically interacting with webpage elements and browser properties using JavaScript.
