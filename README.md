# Developing Web Applications in JavaScript

This repository contains assignments and independent projects from my JavaScript development course, focusing on core web development skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each project explores practical applications of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and interaction with the Browser Object Model (BOM). The projects are structured to reinforce foundational and advanced JavaScript skills through hands-on examples.

## Projects

### 1. Browser Object Model / Document Object Model (BOM, DOM)

This section includes exercises and projects related to the BOM and DOM, providing practical experience in dynamically interacting with web page elements and browser properties using JavaScript.
